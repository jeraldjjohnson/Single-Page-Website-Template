<h1>Single Page Website Template using Flexbox</h1>

<p>This template includes full-width multiple sections, fixed header that animates from a large size to a smaller size as the user scrolls down the page, menu navigation that smoothly scrolls to different sections of the page, and it's responsive. 
</p>

<p>This page is built with Jade, SASS, and Flexbox architecture. If you're unaware of any of these, please check out the below links for further insights. </p>

There is browser support for IE, FF, Chrome, Safari; however, because this IE 9 and earlier does not support flexbox you will need to create fallbacks. If you don't need support for those early versions of IE, then you're gold!
